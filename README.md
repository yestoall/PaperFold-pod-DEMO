# PaperFold cocoapod DEMO

**rubymotion** demos for **PaperFold-iOS** (original created by honcheng -> https://github.com/honcheng/PaperFold-for-iOS)

i've port these great cocoa paper fold code to a cocoapod, for use it in rubymotion proyects

you need two gems for playing with these demos: **sugarcube** and **motion-cocoapods**

or, use bundler to install the gems (if you have problems with an "incompatible
version of rake" error message, use bundler instead).  if you also use `rvm`,
you can use the same gemset for all three demos.

**demo1**: left fold

**demo2**: left fold with two tables

**demo3**: left, right, up and down multifolds (work with controllers)

(sorry about my english, my spanish is better)
